    "**Valence bond (VB) theory** assumes that the electrons in a molecule occupy atomic orbitals of the individual atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Molecular orbital (MO) theory**, assumes the formation of molecular orbitals from the atomic orbitals.\n",
    "\n",
    "Valence bond theory: When the two atoms are far apart, there is no interaction. We say that the potential energy of this system (that is, the two H atoms) is zero. As the atoms approach each other, each electron is attracted by the nucleus of the other atom; at the same time, the electrons repel each other, as do the nuclei. While the atoms are still separated, attraction is stronger than repulsion, so that the potential energy of the system decreases (that is, it becomes negative) as the atoms approach each other. This trend continues until the potential energy reaches a minimum value. At this point, when the system has the lowest potential energy, it is most stable. This condition corresponds to substantial overlap of the $1s$ orbitals and the formation of a stable $\\ce{H2}$ molecule. If the distance between nuclei were to decrease further, the potential energy would rise steeply and finally become positive as a result of the increased electron-electron and nuclear-nuclear repulsions. In accord with the law of conservation of energy, the decrease in potential energy as a result of $\\ce{H2}$ formation must be accompanied by a release of energy. The converse is also true. To break a $\\ce{H-H}$ bond, energy must be supplied to the molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "The concept of overlapping atomic orbitals applies equally well to diatomic molecules other than $\\ce{H2}$. Thus, a stable $\\ce{F2}$ molecule forms when the $2p$ orbitals (containing the unpaired electrons) in the two $\\ce{F}$ atoms overlap to form a covalent bond. Similarly, the formation of the $\\ce{HF}$ molecule can be explained by the overlap of the $1s$ orbital in $\\ce{H}$ with the $2p$ orbital in $\\ce{F}$. In each case, valence bond theory accounts for the changes in potential energy as the distance between the reacting atoms changes. Because the orbitals involved are not the same kind in all cases, we can see why the bond enthalpies and bond lengths in $\\ce{H2}$, $\\ce{F2}$, and $\\ce{HF}$ might be different. "
