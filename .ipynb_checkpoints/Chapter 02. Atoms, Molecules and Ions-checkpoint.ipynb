The ratio of electric charge to the mass of an individual electron can be calculated based on electromagnetic theory. \n",

    "The experiment entailed observing tiny electrically charged droplets of oil located between two parallel metal surfaces. when the gravitational force and external electric force are balanced, the charge on the oil droplet can be calculated. By repeating the experiment for many droplets, they confirmed that the charges were all small integer multiples of a certain base value, which was found to be $1.5924(17)\\times10^{−19}\\,\\text{C}$, about $0.6\\%$ difference from the currently accepted value of $1.602176487(40)\\times10^{−19}\\,\\text{C}$.\n",

He observed that the majority of particles penetrated the foil either undeflected or with only a slight deflection. In some instances, an α particle actually bounced back in the direction from which it had come! To explain the results of the α-scattering experiment, Rutherford devised a new model of atomic structure, suggesting that most of the atom must be empty space. This structure would allow most of the α particles to pass through the gold foil with little or no deflection. The atom's positive charges, Rutherford proposed, are all concentrated in the nucleus, a dense central core within the atom. Whenever an α particle came close to a nucleus in the scattering experiment, it experienced a large repulsive force and therefore a large deflection. Moreover, an α particle traveling directly toward a nucleus would experience an enormous repulsion that could completely reverse the direction of the moving particle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Chadwick’s Experiment**\n",
    "\n",
    "It was known that hydrogen, the simplest atom, contains only one proton and that the helium atom contains two protons. Therefore, the ratio of the mass of a helium atom to that of a hydrogen atom should be 2:1. (Because electrons are much lighter than protons, their contribution can be ignored.) In reality, however, the ratio is 4:1. Rutherford and others postulated that there must be another type of subatomic particle in the atomic nucleus; the proof was provided by another English physicist, James Chadwick, in 1932. When Chadwick bombarded a thin sheet of beryllium with α particles, a very high energy radiation similar to γ rays was emitted by the metal. Later experiments showed that the rays actually consisted of electrically neutral particles having a mass slightly greater than that of protons. Chadwick named these particles neutrons."

    "(Most complicated part!) An **oxoacid** is an acid that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and another element.  The formulas of oxoacids are usually written with the H first, followed by the central element and then O. We use the following five common acids as our references in naming oxoacids:\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Addition of one O atom to the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “per… -ic” acid. Thus, adding an O atom to $\\ce{HClO3}$ changes chloric acid to perchloric acid, $\\ce{HClO4}$.\n",
    "2. Removal of one O atom from the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “-ous” acid. Thus, nitric acid, $\\ce{HNO3}$, becomes nitrous acid, $\\ce{HNO2}$.\n",
    "3. Removal of two O atoms from the “-ic” acid: The acid is called “hypo… -ous” acid. Thus, when $\\ce{HBrO3}$ is converted to $\\ce{HBrO}$, the acid is called hypobromous acid.\n",

    "The rules for naming anions of oxoacids, called *oxoanions*, are\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When all the H ions are removed from the “-ic” acid, the anion's name ends with “-ate.” For example, the anion  derived from $\\ce{H2CO3}$ is called carbonate.\n",
    "2. When all the H ions are removed from the “-ous” acid, the anion's name ends with “-ite.” Thus, the anion  derived from $\\ce{HClO2}$ is called chlorite.\n",
    "3. The names of anions in which one or more but not all of the hydrogen ions have been removed must indicate the number of H ions present. For example, consider the anions derived from phosphoric acid:\n",
