    "**Electronegativity** is the ability of an atom to attract toward itself the electrons in a chemical bond. \n",

    "Electronegativity is related to electron affinity and ionization energy. Thus, an atom such as fluorine, which has a high electron affinity (tends to pick up electrons easily) and a high ionization energy (does not lose electrons easily), has a high electronegativity. On the other hand, sodium has a low electron affinity, a low ionization energy, and a low electronegativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, electronegativity increases from left to right across a period in the periodic table, as the metallic character of the elements decreases. Within each group, electronegativity decreases with increasing atomic number, and increasing metallic character.\n",

    "* A polar covalent bond forms when the electronegativity difference between the atoms is in the range of 0.3–2.0. \n",
    "* If the electronegativity difference is below 0.3, the bond is normally classified as a covalent bond, with little or no polarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Electronegativity and electron affinity are related but different concepts. Both indicate the tendency of an atom to attract electrons. However, electron affinity refers to an isolated atom's attraction for an additional electron, whereas electronegativity signifies the ability of an atom in a chemical bond (with another atom) to attract the shared electrons.\n",
