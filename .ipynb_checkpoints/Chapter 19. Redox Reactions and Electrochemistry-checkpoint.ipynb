    "## 1. Redox Reactions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Redox** (short for reduction–oxidation reaction) is a chemical reaction in which the oxidation states of atoms are changed. Any such reaction involves both a *reduction* process and a complementary *oxidation* process. \n",
    "* **Oxidation** is the loss of electrons or an increase in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n",
    "* **Reduction** is the gain of electrons or a decrease in oxidation state by a molecule, atom, or ion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:  \n",
    "<img src=\"https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a8/NaF.gif\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, $\\ce{Na}$ loses one electron becoming $\\ce{Na+}$. We call this process the oxidation of $\\ce{Na}$. Simultaneously, $\\ce{F}$ gains one electron becoming $\\ce{F-}$. This process is called the reduction of $\\ce{F}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reducing agent** is an element or compound that loses (or \"donates\") an electron to another chemical species in a redox chemical reaction. Since the reducing agent is losing electrons, it is said to have been oxidized.  \n",
    "**Oxidizing agent** is a substance that has the ability to oxidize other substances (cause them to lose electrons). In a redox reaction, the oxidizing agent itself is reduced. "

    "### Oxidation Number\n",
    "\n",
    "The **oxidation state**, often called the **oxidation number**, is an indicator of the degree of oxidation (loss of electrons) of an atom in a chemical compound. Conceptually, the oxidation state, which may be positive, negative or zero, is the hypothetical charge that an atom would have if all bonds to atoms of different elements were 100% ionic, with no covalent component. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. The oxidation state of a free element (uncombined element) is zero. \n",
    "2. For a simple (monatomic) ion, the oxidation state is equal to the net charge on the ion. \n",
    "3. Hydrogen has an oxidation state of +1 and oxygen has an oxidation state of −2 when they are present in most compounds. Exceptions to this are that hydrogen has an oxidation state of −1 in hydrides of active metals, e.g. $\\ce{LiH}$, and oxygen has an oxidation state of −1 in peroxides, e.g. $\\ce{H2O2}$. \n",
    "4. Group IA metals have oxidation states of +1; IIA metals have +2. Fluorine always has an oxidation state of -1. \n",
    "5. The algebraic sum of oxidation states of all atoms in a neutral molecule must be zero, while in ions the algebraic sum of the oxidation states of the constituent atoms must be equal to the charge on the ion. "
