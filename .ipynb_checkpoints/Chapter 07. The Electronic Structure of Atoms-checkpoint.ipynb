    "1. Each shell or principal level of quantum number $n$ contains $n$ subshells. For example, if $n = 2$, then there are two subshells (two values of $l$) of angular momentum quantum numbers $0$ and $1$.\n",

    "3. No more than two electrons can be placed in each orbital. Therefore, the maximum number of electrons is simply twice the number of orbitals that are employed.\n",
    "4. A quick way to determine the maximum number of electrons that an atom can have in a principal level $n$ is to use the formula $2n^2$.\n",

    "When $n=3$, $l$ could be 0, 1, 2, corresponding to $s$, $p$ and $d$ orbitals. <br>\n",
    "In $s$ orbital, $m_l$ must be 0. Thus, there is only one $s$ orbital.  <br>\n",
    "When $l=1$, $m_l$ has three possible values ($-1$, 0, $=1$), thus there are three $p$ orbitals. <br>\n",
    "When $l=2$, $m_l$ has five possible values ($-2$, $-1$, 0, $=1$, $+2$), thus there are five $d$ orbitals. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The total number of orbitals is $1+3+5=9$. Each orbital can host two electrons with $m_s = \\pm \\frac{1}{2}$, respectively. Thus, the maximum number of electrons that can be present in the principal level $n=3$ is 18. \n",

    "### 3.4. The Building-Up Principle\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Aufbau principle** dictates that as protons are added one by one to the nucleus to build up the elements, electrons are similarly added to the atomic orbitals. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the electron configuration of argon ($Z=18$) is $1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^6$. Potassium ($Z=19$) has one more proton and one more electron than argon. The electron configuration of potassium is $1s^22s^22p^63s^23p^64s^1$. Because $3d$ orbitals have higher energy than $4s$ orbital, the outmost layer electron of potassium goes to $4s$ rather than $3d$. Since the inner layer electron configuration of potassium is the same as argon, the electron configuration of potassium can be written as $[\\ce{Ar}]4s^1$ where [Ar] denotes the “argon core.”\n",
    "\n",
    "The electron configurations of all elements except hydrogen and helium are represented by a noble gas core, which shows in brackets the noble gas element that most nearly precedes the element being considered, followed by the symbol for the highest filled subshells in the outermost shells. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Transition metals** either have incompletely filled $d$ subshells or readily give rise to cations that have incompletely filled $d$ subshells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the first transition metal series, from scandium through copper. In this series additional electrons are placed in the $3d$ orbitals, according to Hund's rule. However, there are two irregularities. The electron configuration of chromium ($Z = 24$) is $[\\ce{Ar}]4s^13d^5$ and not $[\\ce{Ar}]4s^23d^4$, as we might expect. A similar break in the pattern is observed for copper, whose electron configuration is $[\\ce{Ar}]4s^13d^{10}$ rather than $[\\ce{Ar}]4s^23d^9$. The reason for these irregularities is that a slightly greater stability is associated with the half-filled ($3d^5$) and completely filled ($3d^{10}$) subshells. \n",
    "\n",
    "Following lanthanum are the 14 elements known as the **lanthanides**, or rare earth series [cerium ($Z = 58$) to lutetium ($Z = 71$)]. The rare earth metals have incompletely filled $4f$ subshells or readily give rise to cations that have incompletely filled $4f$ subshells.\n",
