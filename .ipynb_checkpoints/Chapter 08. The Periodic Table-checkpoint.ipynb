Another trend in the chemical behavior of the representative elements is the diagonal relationship. **Diagonal relationships** are similarities between pairs of elements in different groups and periods of the periodic table.

The reason for this phenomenon is the closeness of the charge densities of their cations.\n",

In Groups 3A through 6A, where the elements change either from nonmetals to metals or from nonmetals to metalloids, it is natural to expect greater variation in chemical properties even though the members of the same group have similar outer electron configurations.\n",
